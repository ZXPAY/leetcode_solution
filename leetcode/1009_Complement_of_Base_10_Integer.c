/*
Every non-negative integer n has a binary representation.  For example, 5 can be represented as "101" in binary, 11 as "1011" in binary, and so on.  Note that except for n = 0, there are no leading zeroes in any binary representation.

The complement of a binary representation is the number in binary you get when changing every 1 to a 0 and 0 to a 1.  For example, the complement of "101" in binary is "010" in binary.

For a given number n in base-10, return the complement of it's binary representation as a base-10 integer.
